# WebChart
Chart Web Application
Tools used:
1. HTML
2. PHP
3. MySQL
4. AJAX
5. Google Chart API
6. Bootstrap
7. XAMPP

Starting the application:
1. Create a database Chart with two tables 
       -multiplier(num number)
       -webchart(sno number,values number,timestamp timestamp) 
2. Change index.php
     line 2: ("localhost","saikat","saikat") to ("localhost","YourUsername","YourPassword")
3. Change insert.php
     line 3: ("localhost","saikat","saikat") to ("localhost","YourUsername","YourPassword")
4. Since I have used used CDN links of all the APIs so the solution would require an active internet connection.
